    <h2>How to make:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil all the meat ingredients until the meat is half tender and no longer bleeds. Remove and drain the meat then cut into cubes according to taste. Set aside. Save the meat cooking water/broth to make gravy. Set aside.</li>
      <li>Saute ground spices until fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add lime leaves, turmeric leaves and bay leaves. Saute again until completely cooked. Remove and divide the spices into 2 parts.</li>
      <li>Take 1 part of the spices then mix it with the meat that has been cut into pieces. Transfer to a pan then pour enough water (until the meat is submerged). Cook/uncover the meat until tender and the spices are absorbed. Lift.</li>
      <li>Take the meat then skewer it and arrange it on the skewers. Do it until the end.</li>
      <li>Grill the satay briefly over fire or a flat non-stick/Teflon frying pan. Lift.</li>
      <li><strong>Satay sauce</strong>: Take 1 part of the remaining spices then cook with the boiled meat water and kandis acid until it boils. Add the rice flour which has been dissolved in a little water. Stir continuously (so as not to clump) until thick and bubbling. Correct the taste. Lift.</li>
      <li><strong>Solution</strong>: Arrange satay with lontong/ketupat. Drizzle with satay sauce. Sprinkle with fried shallots.</li>
